To train custom dataset using darket, you need to prepare for the right yolo format. Please refer [darknet-custom-train.ipynb](./darknet-custom-train.ipynb) for how to prepare public dataset from kaggle for training.

See [Alexey Darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-train-to-detect-your-custom-objects) for fundamental darknet training information.
